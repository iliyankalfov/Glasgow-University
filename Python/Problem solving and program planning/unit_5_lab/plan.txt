1. A method for reading the cities with their coordinates from "Cities.txt" 
	and returning them as a dictionary with cities as keys and values as coordinates

2. A method for finding the distance between two cities
	- using pythagorean theorem

3. A method for finding the closest city when given a starting point
	- iterating through all of the cities and using the method
for finding the distance between the starting city and the current city

4. A method for constructing the route according to the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
	- it returns a list with the cities ordered by the algorithm and the total length of the route

5. A method for finding the best route with the cities from a given dictionary
	- it uses the upper method for calculating the route length of every route with different starting points
	- it returns the city with the best route according to its length
