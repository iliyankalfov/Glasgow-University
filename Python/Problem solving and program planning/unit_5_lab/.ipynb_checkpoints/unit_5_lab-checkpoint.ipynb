    "* an engineer has to visit a number of customers and return to base; \n",
    "* rubbish has to be picked up and then dumped; \n",
    "* a robot on a factory floor has to deliver parts to machines and then return to the store room;\n",
    "* logistics companies need to deliver goods throughout the country, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all such cases, a shorter round trip saves time and money. In principle, this problem can be solved by trying out all of the possible tours, that is, all of the possible orders in which the points might be visited, noting the length of each and choosing the shortest. \n",

    "Clearly, for anything but a small number of points, exhaustive search is infeasible. Therefore, we are usually forced to relax our requirements, and rather than demand an optimal tour, we accept a sub-optimal tour that can be computed in a reasonable amount of time. One approach that may seem reasonable is known as the *Nearest Neighbour Algorithm*, described below. It is easy to implement, but unfortunately it often finds a tour that is not very close to optimal. Your task is to implement the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm."

    "The *Nearest Neighbour Algorithm* constructs a particular tour. A starting point is selected, and we call this the current point. We then select, as the next point in the tour, the point that is closest to the current point. We move to that point and repeat the process, selecting next the unvisited point that is closest to our new current point. The process terminates when we have visited all of the points, and we then have to travel directly back to our starting point. \n",

    "1. Make sure you understand very clearly how the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm works. The description of the algorithm makes it clear that you should use a list of cities, but what data structure will you use to represent the data about each individual city?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a top-level plan for this problem, and refinements for each major step. Think about how you will break up the program into appropriate functions. Type your plan into the file `plan.txt`, which will form part of your solution (**Tutors, please make sure to check this!**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Working from your plan, implement the program and test it. As well as testing your program with the given file of cities, you might find it useful to create your own test files in which it is obvious what the tour should be. You can start by reading the data from the file and drawing a tour in which the cities are visited in exactly the order that they occur in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (*optional*) The Nearest Neighbour Algorithm will give tours of different lengths for different starting points. Instead of just starting from the first city in the file, calculate the length of the Nearest Neighbour tour for each starting point in turn, and display the shortest tour that you find."
