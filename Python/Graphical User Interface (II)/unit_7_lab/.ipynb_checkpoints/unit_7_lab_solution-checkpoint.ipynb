    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/poem.png\" width=90%>\n",

    "    * At least three nouns\n",
    "    * At least three verbs\n",
    "    * At least three adjectives\n",
    "    * At least three prepositions\n",
    "    * At least one adverb\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. If too few words are entered into any of the Entry widgets, then a descriptive error message should be displayed in the area where the generated poem is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The program should check the user inputs unique words into each `Entry` widget. For example, if the user enters the same noun into the noun `Entry` widget twice, then the application should display an error message when the user tries to generate the poem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The program should randomly select three nouns, three verbs, three adjectives and three prepositions as well as one adverb from the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using the randomly selected words, the program should generate and display a poem with the following structure inspired by [Clifford Pickover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_A._Pickover):\n",

    "    `{A/An} {adj1} {noun1}`\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Here, `adj` stands for adjective and `prep` for preposition. Each time your program run, it should generate a new poem.\n",

    "# C. [Optional] Simulating an ATM\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this task is to write a program that (somewhat) simulates the operation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). Make sure to write a plan for the\n",
    "program before starting to write any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To do this exercise you will need to know about pickling. You will find more guidance on this below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank account details are held in a file accounts.pck, which contains the pickled form of a dictionary with a certain structure which will be explained later. When the program is started, a dictionary storing bank account details is loaded from this file. The program then expects an account number to be entered (simulating the reading of a bank card), followed by a PIN. If the PIN is correct, a menu of options is offered, consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `w` – withdraw money\n",
    "* `d` – deposit money\n",
    "* `b` – display current balance\n",
    "* `m` – produce a mini-statement (details of the last 6 transactions)\n",
    "* `c` – cancel request\n",
    "\n",
    "When the transaction is complete, the program again expects an account number. This\n",
    "process continues until the account number `0` is entered, at which point the dictionary of account details is dumped to a new file called *new_accounts.pck*, and the program terminates. (It would be more realistic to dump the account details back to the original file, but this would make program development more problematic – the file might become corrupted because of programming errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of choosing each of the options is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `w`: the program expects to input a floating-point number, representing the amount to be withdrawn. If this does not exceed the balance in the account, this amount is\n",
    "  subtracted from the balance, and the list of the last 6 transactions is updated,\n",
    "  otherwise an error message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `d`: the program expects to input a floating-point number, representing the amount to be deposited. This amount is added to the balance, and the list of the last 6\n",
    "  transactions is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `b`: the current balance in the account is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `m`: a \"mini-statement\", consisting of the last 6 transactions, together with the current balance, is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `c`: the transaction is cancelled (i.e., nothing is done to this account)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structure is a dictionary with account numbers (represented by strings) as keys, and account details as values. **You must use this structure, otherwise you will not be able to use the data in accounts.pck**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details of an account are stored in a dictionary with the following keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"pin\": the PIN, as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"balance\": the account balance, as a floating point number\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"transactions\": a list of the last 6 transactions\n",
    "    \n",
    "One transaction is stored as a dictionary with the following keys and values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"date\": the date and time of the transaction, as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"nature\": a string, \"w\" for a withdrawal or \"d\" for a deposit\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"amount\": the amount of the withdrawal or deposit, as a floating point number\n",
    "    \n",
    "### What you are given\n",
    "\n",
    "When you set up the exercise from the Lab 7 files on Moodle, you will obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   a file `accounts.pck`\n",
    "\n",
    "* a file `date.py`, which you can import as a module; it provides the function *getDate()*  which obtains the current date and time and formats them into a string\n",
    "\n",
    "* a file `display.py`, which you can use to display the account details from a file such as `accounts.pck`. This is useful for testing.\n"
