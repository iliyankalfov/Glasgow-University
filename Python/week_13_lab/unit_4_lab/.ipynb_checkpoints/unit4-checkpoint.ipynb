My solution terminates in less than 3 seconds on the large test cases. If any student writes a solution that takes longer than 30 seconds (considering computer hardware), encourage them to improve their implementation.

I know that everytime I need to find the `next median`, integer at the head of previous list is removed and a new integer is appended to its tail to form the next list. For instance in `fan1.txt`, list for day 6 is [2, 3, 4, 2, 3] and list for day 7 is [3, 4, 2, 3, 6]. So write a function `updateBucket` to handle this removal and insertion in constant time."
