    "for the data from \"books.txt\" with class Book and list of objects - books. The list structure is suitable here because \n",
    "to do the operations afterwards we have to iterate through all of the users and books and remember their properties. \n",
    "Moreover, for remembering the similarity scores of all other users, compared to self, I used a dictionary(self.similarities)\n",

    "when recommending books based on the similarity score of a user from the dictionary, we can easily access the users \n",
    "ratings without having to search in the list of users.\n",

    "the functionalities where the user input does not exist as well as writing the new user to \"ratings.txt\" were the last\n",
    "problems to solve. To finish the solution I used both exception handling and defensive programming\n",
    "for extensive error checking. \n",

    "3. The only part which I think can be hard to follow is the method for printing out the recommendations. It is based on\n",
    "recursion with passing the books, which have already been recommended, and the number of recommendations as arguments. The \n",
    "method terminates when the number of recommendations input by the user is reached. If it is not, the program iterates \n",
    "through the ratings of the user with the highest similarity score and prints out the recommended books. Then it simply goes\n",
    "to the next user from the dictionary by calling the method again. The method calculating similarity scores returns\n",
    "the keys of the dictionary as a list and that is how I keep order of the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Most of the errors that can occur are related to the user input. Therefore for the name and rates I used defensive\n",
    "programming with a while loop. While a valid value occurs they have to be entered. To check if a user with the prompted\n",

    "    users there is constant, hence O(1). Then, to find the similarities of all the users compared to self without self we have to iterate\n",
    "    through the whole list => O(n). Following the sorting of the dictionary we have O(n-1). The last time where the \n",
    "    list of users appears is recommending the books. We get a single user according to an index which means\n",
    "    constant time O(1) and to print the required number of books we will need to iterate at most through all of the users - 1\n",
    "    => O(n-1). Adding all of the parts together, the time complexity according to the number of users results in:\n",
    "        O(n/2) + O(1) + O(n) + O(n-1) + O(1) + O(n-1) = O(3n+n/2) = O(7n/2) = O(n). This implies that the program is executing \n",

    "    the similarity between self and another user. The program iterates through all of the ratings of both users. The number\n",
    "    of ratings depends on the number of books that exist in the file, hence O(m). Then again when recommeding books, \n",
    "    ratings of users are iterated which implies O(m). In the end a book at a specific index is returned\n",

    "    If the username is not present in the list of users, then there are some calculations beforehand. Firstly, 20% of all\n",
    "    the books are chosen at random. Iterating them is time complexity of O(log m). Then the program finds a book at a \n",
